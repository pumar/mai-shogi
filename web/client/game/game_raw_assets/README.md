## About

Repository for shogi pieces and boards I made or modified.

I have a separate repository for chess, chess variants, janggi, xiangqi, sittuyin: [https://github.com/Ka-hu/chess-pieces](https://github.com/Ka-hu/chess-pieces)

Click on the pictures to see them in high resolution.

The filenames are for pychess.org by default, but you can use them with XBoard or other programs by renaming the files. I made a shell script for this, see **shogitool.sh** in this repository. Copy shogitool.sh into the directory of a piece set (eg. kanji_red_wood) and run `./shogitool.sh --help` for more information. For example, you can rename the files to the XBoard naming format by `./shogitool.sh p2x`
